I do the following to append text to multiple lines:

<c-V> - Enter Visual Block mode.
Use j/k to select the lines.
$ - Move cursor to last character.
A - Enter insert mode after last character.
Insert desired text.
<Esc> - Exit insert mode and finish block append.

When compared to writing :norm after selection there are even less key presses, but the real reason why I use this is because it's more instinctive for me to work on Visual Block mode for this type of changes.
