First, you must clone the openproject-deploy repository:

git clone https://github.com/opf/openproject-deploy --depth=1 --branch=stable/12 openproject
Then, change into the compose folder, this folder will be the location where you enter all following commands:

cd openproject/compose
Make sure you are using the latest version of the Docker images:

docker-compose pull
Launch the containers:

OPENPROJECT_HTTPS=false docker-compose up -d
----------------------

You can stop the Compose stack by running:

docker-compose stop
You can stop and remove all containers by running:

docker-compose down
----------------------


All-in-one container
Quick Start
The fastest way to get an OpenProject instance up and running is to run the following command:

docker run -it -p 8080:80 \
  -e OPENPROJECT_SECRET_KEY_BASE=secret \
  -e OPENPROJECT_HOST__NAME=localhost:8080 \
  -e OPENPROJECT_HTTPS=false \
  openproject/community:12

--------------------

If you want to destroy the container, run the following commands

docker stop openproject
docker rm openproject
