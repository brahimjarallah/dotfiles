** Before installing brave First of all install snap:

* * * * Installing snap on Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, snap can be installed from the Arch User Repository (AUR).

The manual build process is the Arch-supported install method for AUR packages, and you’ll need the prerequisites installed before you can install any AUR package. You can then install snap with the following:

# git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd.git
# cd snapd
# makepkg -si

Once installed, the systemd unit that manages the main snap communication socket needs to be enabled:

# sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket

To enable classic snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between /var/lib/snapd/snap and /snap:

# sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap

Either log out and back in again, or restart your system, to ensure snap’s paths are updated correctly.

To test your system, install the hello-world snap and make sure it runs correctly:

# sudo snap install hello-world

hello-world 6.3 from Canonical✓ installed
# hello-world

Hello World!
Snap is now installed and ready to go! If you’re using a desktop, a great next step is to install the Snap Store app.

** now install brave :

# sudo snap install brave
