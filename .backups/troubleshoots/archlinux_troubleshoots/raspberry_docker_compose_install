 a raspberry pi the url part of the command results in

https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.1/docker-compose-Linux-armv7l
Looking at the latest stable release at https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.24.1 you can see there is no download for the armv7l architecture so the file is empty because there is nothing to download.

Will update answer once I figured out how to install docker-compose on Raspian.

Edit:

Via apt-get. Note: Currently (Nov. 8 2019) this installs version 1.21 which is not the latest available.

sudo apt-get install docker-compose
Via pip3. (Installs latest)

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
And then restart your system with

sudo shutdown -r

=====================================================

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-linux-armv7" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
