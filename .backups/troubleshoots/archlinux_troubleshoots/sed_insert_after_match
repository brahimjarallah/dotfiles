 ### Insert a line in a string after finding a match

The following command will search “inng” in the string, “I like programming”, and a line of text, “Do you like programming?” will be inserted after the string if the searching string exists.

Here, the “&” character is used to insert the line after the string.

$ echo "I like programming." | sed 's/inng/& Do you like programming?/'
The following output shows that “inng” does not exist in the string and no line is inserted after the string.


The following command will search “ing.” in the string, “I like programming” and it exists in the string.

$ echo "I like programming." | sed 's/ing./& Do you like programming?/'
The following output shows that the new line is added after the string.
