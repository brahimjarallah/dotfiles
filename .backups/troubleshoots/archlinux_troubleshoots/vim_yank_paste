Yank the word you want to replace with yw.

The yanked word is in the 0 register which you can see by issuing :registers.

Go to the word you want to replace and do cw.
 -> Do Ctrl+r followed by 0
 to paste the 0 register.

The map for that would look something like this (assuming Ctrl+j as our key combo):
:map <C-j> cw<C-r>0<ESC>
