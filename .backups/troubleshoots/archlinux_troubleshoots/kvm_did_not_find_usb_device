Error starting domain: internal error: Did not find USB device 0480:0901

---- Solved -----

So this is how I got it fixed:

virsh edit <vmname> # brings up emacs (or vim for the really smart people) with the xml for the vm

-- added  startupPolicy='optional' to the <source> line as below

  <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb' managed='yes'>
       <source startupPolicy='optional'/>
         <vendor id='0x03f0'/>
         <product id='0x4217'/>
       </source>
     </hostdev
