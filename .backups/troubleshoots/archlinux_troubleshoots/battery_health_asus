*** Create a file which we'll call battery-charge-threshold.service in /etc/systemd/system & paste the following script:

# sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/battery-charge-threshold.service


[Unit]

StartLimitBurst=0

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo 60 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


***   Enable and start the battery-charge-threshold systemd service.

# sudo systemctl enable battery-charge-threshold.service

# sudo systemctl start battery-charge-threshold.service


***   restart the systemd service using the following commands

# sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# sudo systemctl restart battery-charge-threshold.service


***  Verify that the battery charge stop threshold is working.

# cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status

---------------------------------------------------

***   In case you don't use systemd, you can also do this by using cron, by running:

#  sudo crontab -e

and then pasting the following line: 

@reboot echo 60 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
