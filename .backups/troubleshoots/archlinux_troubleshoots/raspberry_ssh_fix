Your ISP may block connections to port 22 (nothing you or your router can do about it). Just set SSHd to run on a different port, e.g. 2222.

In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change Port 22 to Port 2222 and then sudo service ssh restart. Port forward 2222 (or whatever), and try again.

------------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get purge openssh-server 
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

sudo service ssh status
sudo service ssh start


ssh -L localport:127.0.0.1:22 pi@192.168.1.192 -p 2222
---------------------------------------

Remove the cached key for 192.168.1.123 on the local machine:

ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.123

# Connected to the Internet, but can't ssh or ping ==>>>

This happens a lot with one of my Raspberry Pis. I have a script which checks for an Internet connection and runs ifup wlan0 when a connection is not present. Some of the things you could try:

    Rebooting the Raspberry Pi
    Checking that you have a valid IP address using ifconfig
    Ensuring that you have power-saving features disabled on the dongle by adding wireless-power off to your /etc/network/interfaces file
    Run ifup --force wlan0

Here's a script which runs every five minutes from cron:

#!/bin/bash
#Script to check the network connection

#Check network connection
if /sbin/ifconfig wlan0 | grep -q "inet addr:" ; then
    #Connection is good; do nothing
    echo "$(date "+%D [%H:%M:%S]") Connection is up"
else
    echo "$(date "+%D [%H:%M:%S]") Network connection down. Attempting to reconnect..."
    sudo /sbin/ifup --force wlan0
fi

If that is a wireless card power management issue, you can also have a look at WLAN disappears after some time.

Many wireless network cards don't support wireless-power off option in /etc/network/interfaces. To disable power management with a 8192CU module loaded, you can create a file sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf with the following contents.

# Disable power management
options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0
