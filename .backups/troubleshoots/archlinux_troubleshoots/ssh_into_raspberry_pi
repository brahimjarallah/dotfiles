 how to enable SSH on a Raspberry Pi and connect to it via SSH. 

1. Image Your Raspberry Pi SD Card
 Download the Raspberry Pi Imager 
paru rpi-imager

Open the Raspberry Pi Imager and click on CHOOSE OS.
but we will be using the Rpi Lite (32-bit) version

2. Enable SSH Access on Raspberry Pi

 Create an empty file called ssh

at the root of your SD card.
touch /Volumes/boot/ssh

3. Set Up WiFi on Raspberry Pi

Create a file at the root of the SD card called wpa_supplicant.conf

#vim wpa_supplicant.conf
'''
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<US>
network={
 ssid="WIFI_NAME"
 psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
'''

If you’d like, you can assign your Raspberry Pi a hostname instead of using the IP address directly. In order to map a hostname to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, you simply need to edit the hosts file on your computer.
When you’ve done that, eject the SD card from your computer and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

4. Find the IP Address of Raspberry Pi


In order to connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH, execute the following command.
# ping raspberrypi.local

5. Login to Raspberry Pi vis SSH

ssh pi@192.168.0.136

The default Raspberry Pi username is pi
and the default password is raspberry
