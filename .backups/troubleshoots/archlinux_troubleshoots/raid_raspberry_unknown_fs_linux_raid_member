mount: unknown filesystem type 'linux_raid_member'


You should not mount it directly using mount.
You need first to run mdadm to assemble the raid array. A command like this should do it:

mdadm --assemble --run /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1

If it refuses to run the array because it will be degraded, then you can use --force option.
This is assuming you don't have /dev/md0 device. Otherwise, you need to change this name.

When this command is executed successfully, you can mount the created device normally using:

mount /dev/md0 /mnt/test
