Install XScreenSaver on  linux:

XScreensaver is included in Ubuntu software repositoray as like some other distributions, so you can easily install it by running the following command in a terminal window.

# sudo pacman -S xscreensaver

To check your XScreenSaver version, execute the following command:

# xscreensaver --help
---------------------------------------------------------
Autostart with Systemd service

Alternatively, you can get XScreenSaver autostart at boot time with Systemd :

First, execute the following command to create a directory for storing Systemd service file of individual users.

# mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/

Then create xscreensaver.service file with a command line text editor such as Nano

# vim ~/.config/systemd/user/xscreensaver.service

** Copy and paste the following text into the file :

[Unit]
Description=XScreenSaver
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xscreensaver -nosplash
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target


** Finally, enable this service so that XScreenSaver will be automatically started at boot time.

# systemctl --user enable xscreensaver

** How to Get XScreenSaver Autostart at boot time
Since Ubuntu comes with gnome-screensaver, which is a fork of XScreenSaver, we need to remove gnome-screensaver in order to autostart XScreenSaver at boot time.

# sudo pacman -R gnome-screensaver

Now start the xscreensaver configuration tool - from a terminal:

# xscreensaver-demo


starting xscreensaver from login

# sudo ln -s /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command

Logout or reboot for all changes to take effect.
--------------------------------------
** to lock secreen use:
# xscreensaver-command --lock
---------------------------------------

R.M :
to tell xscreensaver never to automatically activate the screensaver, except with a manual command :

One solution is to set the timeout to :

# timeout: 100000:00:00
