Removal of mdadm RAID Devices
In order to remove the mdadm RAID Devices our Support Techs recommend the following steps:

Step 1: Unmount and Remove all Filesystems

We need to make sure all filesystems have been unmounted. For that, we use umount. It also ensures we have exclusive access to the disk.

umount /dev/md1
Step 2: Determine mdadm RAID Devices

To do so, we run the following command:

cat /proc/mdstat

cat /proc/mdstat
For example, the output will be like this:

md1 : active raid1 sdf1[1] sde1[0] 2929555456 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU] bitmap: 0/22 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk md0 : active raid10 sda1[3] sdd1[1] sdb1[0] sdc1[2] 976502784 blocks super 1.2 512K chunks 2 near-copies [4/4] [UUUU] 
unused devices: &lt;none&gt;
Now, we need to make sure we take a note of the disks that are part of the RAID group.

When we proceed to step 5, we will need the names.

Step 3: Stop mdadm RAID Device

Our next step is to stop the device.

mdadm --stop /dev/md1
For example, the output will look similar to this:

mdadm: stopped /dev/md1
Step 4: Remove mdadm RAID Device

mdadm --remove /dev/md1
At time, we may come across the following error:

mdadm: error opening md1: No such file or directory
Then, we go ahead with the following step.

Step 5: Remove the Superblocks

mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdf1 /dev/sde1
Step 6: Verify RAID Device Was Removed

Finally, we use lsblk and cat /proc/mdstat and confirm there are no active RAID devices.
