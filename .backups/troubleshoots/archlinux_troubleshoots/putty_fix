fix iputty Gtk-WARNING cannot open display:

You should enable X11Forwarding in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and then see what happens.

Excerpt from a config file:

 X11Forwarding yes
 X11DisplayOffset 10
 PrintMotd no
 PrintLastLog yes
 TCPKeepAlive yes


****  X11 has to be open before you run visualsfm. You can open it in Applications -> Utilities -> X11. You must also define which display to use. Use printenv to see if the DISPLAY variable is set. If it is not set then use the following command:

# export DISPLAY=":0"

add this command to your .profile settings in your home folder to set it every time you open a terminal.


other command:
# env -i DISPLAY=:0 putty

***** TO see tty serial ports:
# dmesg | grep tty
