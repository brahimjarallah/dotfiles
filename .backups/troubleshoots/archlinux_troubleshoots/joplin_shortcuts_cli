ShortcutsðŸ”—
There are two types of shortcuts: those that manipulate the user interface directly, such as TAB to move from one pane to another, and those that are simply shortcuts to actual commands. In a way similar to Vim, these shortcuts are generally a verb followed by an object. For example, typing mn ([m]ake [n]ote), is used to create a new note: it will switch the interface to command line mode and pre-fill it with mknote "" from where the title of the note can be entered. See below for the full list of default shortcuts:

:                 enter_command_line_mode
TAB               focus_next
SHIFT_TAB         focus_previous
UP                move_up
DOWN              move_down
PAGE_UP           page_up
PAGE_DOWN         page_down
ENTER             activate
DELETE, BACKSPACE delete
(SPACE)           todo toggle $n
n                 next_link
b                 previous_link
