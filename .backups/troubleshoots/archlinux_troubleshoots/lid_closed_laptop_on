To disable entering the sleep mode I had to edit the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file and modify the line:

#HandleLidSwitch=suspend
to
HandleLidSwitch=ignore

Additionally, ensure that the file also has this line:

LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=no

Then restart the OS via:

sudo service systemd-logind restart
