vor vim keybinding use:
    BASH: set -o vi (set -o emacs)
--> ZSH : bindkey -v (bindkey -e)       // to  .zprofile
    FISH : fish_vi_key_bindings (fish_default_key_bindings)


----  To use clear screen with ctl+l using vim :

Ctrl+L is also bound in vi command mode but not in insert mode. There's no default binding for clear-screen in insert mode. Readline bindings should be specified in ~/.inputrc, like so:

set editing-mode vi
$if mode=vi

set keymap vi-command
# these are for vi-command mode
Control-l: clear-screen

set keymap vi-insert
# these are for vi-insert mode
Control-l: clear-screen 
$endif
