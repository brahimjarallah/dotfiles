sudo yum remove docker-compose
If installed via curl

sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
If installed via pip

pip uninstall docker-compose
Then find the newest version on the release page at GitHub or by curling the API and extracting the version from the response using grep or jq (thanks to dragon788, frbl, and Saber Hayati for these improvements):

# curl + grep
VERSION=$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep -Po '"tag_name": "\K.*\d')

# curl + jq
VERSION=$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | jq .name -r)
Finally, download to your favorite $PATH-accessible location and set permissions:

DESTINATION=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o $DESTINATION
sudo chmod 755 $DESTINATION
